This is an older issue, but it's still marked as OPEN and I feel like this might be a meaningful contribution:

https://github.com/Flare576/dotfiles/blob/master/.jira.d/config.yml

I have ~20 custom commands I use on a daily basis.

(What follows is a super-long-winded example of using the most common ones. Feel
free to ignore and just look through the config!)

My current project has moved to a hosted Jira instance, so I'm not able to rely
on the API token anymore (I miss it a lot). So, every morning I have to load up
the website, grab the cookie from a XHR request, and run

jira cookie 'whatever=stuff; was=in_there'
after that, I pull down the tickets from the current sprint

jira s

and read through them. Our team operates on "devs should grab from the QA
column if there's a story there" so I usually pick up the first ticket in QA,
say 123

jira w PROJ-123
jira v

which will then spit out the ticket data. If it turns out I can't actually do
anything with it, I pop it off and grab the next one

jira w -r
jira w PROJ-124

Once I find a story I can work, say it's still a QA story, I need to mark myself
the reviewer (our team has a custom field so we don't step on each-other's toes)


jira qa -r

and then copy the Acceptance Criteria out of the vim window that opens. I then open the story for review


jira r

and use the provided template to review. After filling out the template and :wq
from vim, go-jira pops open a transition window for me, defaulted to Sign Off,
optimistically assuming the story passed. If it didn't, I can Ctrl+Z to
background the vim doc and do


jira ts

to see the valid transitions for the story, then fill in that data going back to fg.
